          When our kids were in elementary school and preparing to take the CogAT, we were frustrated by the
          extremely limited number of test preparation resources available to us. We knew that it was important
          for our kids to practice with full-length tests so that they could be prepared for test day.
          It was also important to us that there was a data-driven approach to test-taking â€” one that dove
          deep and analyzed their weak spots so that they could practice and improve on those questions
          that were the most challenging for them. This is why we created AceCogAT.ai, which helped our kids
          practice for the CogAT and gain acceptance into the gifted program in our state.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We are excited to continue building tools and apps that will help your child succeed in their
          academic journey.
